# Question: How do you check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree? C# Summary

The provided C# code defines a binary tree and checks if it is a valid binary search tree. A binary search tree is a tree in which all nodes follow the property that all nodes to the left of a node have values less than the node, and all nodes to the right have values greater than the node. The code first defines a Node class with properties for Value, Left, and Right. It then creates a binary tree with a root node and additional nodes to the left and right of the root. The function IsBinarySearchTree is used to check if the tree is a valid binary search tree. It does this by recursively checking each node in the tree, starting from the root. If a node is null, it returns true. If a node's value is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum, it returns false. The function then recursively checks the left and right nodes, updating the minimum and maximum values as it traverses the tree. If all nodes pass these checks, the function returns true, indicating that the tree is a valid binary search tree.

# Python Differences

The Python and C# versions of the solution are very similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both versions use a recursive function (`IsBinarySearchTree` in C# and `is_bst` in Python) to traverse the binary tree and check if it is a binary search tree. The function checks if the value of the current node is within the valid range (between `min_val` and `max_val`), and then recursively checks the left and right subtrees.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Class Definition: In Python, the `Node` class is defined using the `class` keyword and the constructor method is `__init__`. In C#, the `Node` class is defined using the `public class` keywords and the constructor method is the class name `Node`.

2. Null/None Checking: In C#, `null` is used to represent the absence of a value or object. In Python, `None` is used for the same purpose.

3. Default Parameters: Both versions use default parameters for the `min_val` and `max_val` arguments in the recursive function. In C#, the default values are specified using the `=` operator in the function signature. In Python, the default values are specified in the same way.

4. Print Statements: In Python, the `print` function is used to print to the console. In C#, the `Console.WriteLine` method is used for the same purpose.

5. Main Function: In Python, the `main` function is defined and then called within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This is a common Python idiom for specifying the entry point of a script. In C#, the `Main` method is the entry point of the program and is called automatically when the program is run.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem in a similar way. They both define a Node class with properties for the node's value and its left and right children. They also both define a method to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree. This method works by recursively checking if the left and right subtrees are binary search trees and if the current node's value is within the valid range.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences between the C# and Java languages themselves. 

1. In C#, the Node class has a constructor that takes the node's value and optional left and right children as parameters. In Java, the Node class has a constructor that only takes the node's value as a parameter, and the left and right children are set to null.

2. In C#, the `IsBinarySearchTree` method is a static method in the Program class, and it takes the root of the tree and optional minimum and maximum values as parameters. In Java, the `isBST` and `isBSTUtil` methods are instance methods in the BinaryTree class. The `isBST` method doesn't take any parameters and calls `isBSTUtil` with the root of the tree and the minimum and maximum integer values.

3. In C#, the `IsBinarySearchTree` method uses the `&&` operator to combine the results of the recursive calls for the left and right subtrees. In Java, the `isBSTUtil` method uses the `&&` operator in the same way.

4. The way of printing the result is different in both languages. In C#, it uses `Console.WriteLine` while in Java, it uses `System.out.println`.

5. The naming convention is different in both languages. In C#, PascalCase is used for methods and classes, while in Java, camelCase is used.
